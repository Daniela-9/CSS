                <h3>The Melissani Cave is located about 2km from the Sami village on the island of Kefalonia.</h3>

                <p>The cave lake is one of the most popular tourist attractions on the island. </p>

                <p>With its two chambers,one dark and covered with stalagmites and the other sunlit through a huge opening to the surface.</p>

                <p>The area only opened to the public in the early 1960s, with plenty of travelers rowing through its stunning blue water since then.</p>
